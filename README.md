# MiniTube-JavaME

A lightweight YouTube client for Java ME (MIDP 2.0) devices.

## Features

- Search YouTube videos
- Browse video lists
- View video details
- Play videos (3GP/MP4 low-res formats only)

## How it works

This app connects to a lightweight backend service. The backend talks to YouTube and sends simplified data to this Java ME app. This way, even old phones can search and play YouTube videos!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Import the project into your Java ME compatible IDE (e.g., Eclipse with MTJ or NetBeans Mobility Pack).
3. Build and deploy to your Java-enabled device or emulator.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Java ME app source code
- `backend/` - (optional) Helper scripts or proxy backend
